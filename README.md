## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- racket
- WABT (see [this section](#compiling-from-webassembly-text-format-wat-to-webassembly-binary-format-wasm) below)
- node/npm

## Getting Server Running

1. `npm install`
2. `cd server`
3. `node index.js`
4. navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Quick-start

1. Write some wacket (for example, into `example.rkt`)
2. `make example.wat` (optional)
3. `make example.wasm`

## Target Language: WebAssembly

We need to write to `.wat` which is the WebAssembly Text format. From there we can use wat2wasm to turn that into the actual assembly code which can run in the browser.

### WebAssembly Text Format (.wat)
- find the ast for our representation at the bottom of the readme
- wat boolean representation
  - true: 1
  - false: 0

- [Info on Text Format from the WebAssembly GitHub repo](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/text/index.html) (this gets _very_ spec-y)

### Compiling from WebAssembly Text format (.wat) to WebAssembly Binary format (.wasm)
- [Info from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Text_format_to_wasm)
- [WABT: The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt)
  - Think of this as our version of nasm
  - can install from a package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install wabt`)

## The Runtime system

Our runtime system is written in JavaScript, which can interface with compiled WASM bidirectionally.
There is a minimal HTML file to act as an interface to the runtime system.
This must be exposed to localhost with a web server, because modern browsers don't allow for accessing arbitrary files in the filesystem.

## Source Language: wacket

We'll be aiming to implement all the features present in Loot, the reduced version of Racket created in class already.
This should allow for the re-use of much of the compiler infrastructure, like the lexer, parser, and AST.

### note on .wkt files

They start with `#lang wacket`. This caused my syntax checker to tell me:

```
standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found
  for module path: wacket/lang/reader
  collection: "wacket/lang"
  in collection directories:
   /home/chris/.racket/8.4/collects
   /usr/share/racket/collects/
```

To fix this problem, I navigated to `/usr/share/racket/collects/` and ran the command `sudo ln -s racket/ wacket`.
This tricks the syntax checker because it looks at `/usr/share/racket/collects/wacket`, but it's really just a symbolic link to `/usr/share/racket/collects/racket`.

```
type Module = (Module [list of Definitions])

type Definition = Import
                | Export
                | Func
                | Start

type Start = (Start funcname)

;; imports have a 2 level namespace: module then function
type Import = (Import modulename funcname FuncSignature)

;; name is what the RTS will see, ExportFuncSignature is what we use internally
type Export = (Export name ExportFuncSignature)

type ExportFuncSignature = (ExportFuncSignature name)

type Func = (Func FuncSignature [list of Locals] Body)

type FuncSignature = (FuncSignature name? [list of Params] Result?)

type Param = (Param name? Type)

type Result = (Result Type)

type Local = (Local name? Type)

type Type = i32
          | i64
          | f32
          | f64

type Body = (Body [list of Instructions])

type Instruction = (Inst name [list of Instructions])
                 | Const

type Const = (Const v)

```

## Memory Accessing

An instance of memory in WASM is allocated in blocks of 64KB of storage, so a single block should be more than enough
for Wacket.

I found [this article](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/webassembly-the-definitive/9781492089834/ch04.html) to have
the best (and really only) example of manipulating memory in `.wat` files.

### Implementation

Instead of `rbx`, we will use the global variable defined by `heap-name` to store the next available address on the
heap. This is a global variable with the internal name generated by `(gensym 'heap)`.

Some specifics to note:
- Addressing **must** be done with `i32`. Practically, this isn't an issue, since indexing must staer at 0, but it's
  simply another thing to keep in mind.
- Each value still occupies 8 "positions" on the pointer, so we need to increment by 8 each time. This means the logic
  is actually pretty much the same as in racket.
- Just like in class, the cons cell starts with the `cdr` and is followed by the `car` 8 bytes later.
- The `StoreHeap` struct requires the address to be on the stack beforehand. This is so the `car` and `cdr` can be
  stored right next to each other in memory.
